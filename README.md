DAD 492: FINAL Response
Hanna Rowe

For my final project, I decided to make a Christmas sound board. My goal is to make it similar to the Halloween soundboard demo that was uploaded to the tone.js demos website. THe difference of course being Christmas themed. I wanted to make it so the person can play a remix of "Sleigh Ride". If the person didn't want to make a remix, they could just play a few Christmas songs I added.

In order to make my sound board, I wanted to find stems of a orchetra band playing "Sleigh Ride". It was really difficult to find stems that didn't have other instruments playing in the background. Once I found all of my pieces, I added them to my project. I ran into a little bit of an issue where I was limited to only 50 MBs in code sandbox, so I had to cut down the song to a segment. This issue also caused me to only be able to add one song for the christmas music.

I made it intentional that you cannot stop the grinch's song with the Stop all button as a funny haha thing and the only way you can stop him is by refreshing the page.
